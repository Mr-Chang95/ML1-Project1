# Objective 1

### Business Understanding:
  - Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why was this data collected in
the first place?). 
  - Describe how you would define and measure the outcomes from the
dataset. That is, why is this data important and how do you know if you have mined
useful knowledge from the dataset?
  - How would you measure the effectiveness of a
good prediction algorithm?

<hr>

# Objective 2

### Data Understanding: 

  #### - Describe the meaning and type of data (scale, values, etc.) for each attribute in the data file.

<hr>

#### - Verify data quality: Explain any missing values, duplicate data, and outliers. Are those mistakes? How do you deal with these problems? 
    
   - #### Missing Data

<hr> 

- Give simple, appropriate statistics (range, mode, mean, median, variance,
counts, etc.) for the most important attributes and describe what they mean or if you
found something interesting.

#### - Explain the significance of the statistics run and why they are meaningful.

**Range:** The range of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of how spread out the scores are and the variability of the performance of students in these subjects.

   **Mode:** The mode of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the most common score achieved by students in these subjects, which can be useful for identifying areas of strength and weakness.

   **Mean:** The mean of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the average performance of students in these subjects, which can be useful for comparing the performance of different groups of students.

   **Median:** The median of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the central tendency of the scores, which can be useful for identifying outliers and extreme values that may skew the mean.

   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the spread of the scores around the mean, which can be useful for identifying the variability of the performance of students in these subjects.

   **Min:** The minimum score of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the lowest score achieved by students in these subjects.

   **25%, 50%, and 75%**: The quartiles of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the spread and distribution of the scores, which can be useful for identifying the performance of students in different percentile ranges.

   **Max:** The maximum score of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the highest score achieved by students in these subjects.

   **Count**: The count of Reading Score, Math Score, and Writing Score can provide an idea of the sample size of students who took the test in each subject, which can be useful for making inferences about the population of students.

<hr>

####  - Visualize the most important attributes appropriately (at least 5 attributes).
Important: Provide an interpretation for each chart. Explain for each attribute why the
chosen visualization is appropriate.

####  - Explore relationships between attributes: Look at the attributes via scatter
plots, correlation, cross-tabulation, group-wise averages, etc. as appropriate. Explain
any interesting relationships.

####  -  Identify and explain interesting relationships between features and the class
you are trying to predict (i.e., relationships with variables and the target classification).

# Bonus

### Additional Analysis:
  - Provide additional analyses, perhaps implement dimensionality reduction, then visualize and interpret the results.
